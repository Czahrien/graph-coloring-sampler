TODO:
- Implement Markov Chain Step
- Implement sampling algorithm (see www.cs.rit.edu/~bdm8233/MCMCHW5.pdf)
- Determine number of samples (sorry guys, I was wrong about the 2*delta + 1 thing. q is actually bounded by delta + 2)
- Verify it works correctly.
- Put math into paper.
- Put results into paper.
